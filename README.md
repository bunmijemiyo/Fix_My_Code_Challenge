# The Fix My Code Challenge

Fix my code is a new project in which we will dive into an existing code base and fix it!
This is accomplished by using pre-written repositories as the beginning files for all solutions.
I'm not writing any new code, just fixing what's already there.

This is an ALX project in which I was tasked with debugging numerous programs.
The tasks included a diverse set of programming languages.
from C to Python to Javascript to Ruby and more, some of which I knew and others of which I didn't.
The following is a particular list of projects:
